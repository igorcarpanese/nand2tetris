# Nand to Tetris

Welcome to my repository for my project implementations of the book [nand2tetris.org](https://nand2tetris.org).

At the beginning of 2024, some friends decided to read _The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles_ (also known as Nand to Tetris) to learn more about how computers work.

To understand why I decided to join them, let me quote a paragraph from the book's preface:

> We wrote this book because we felt that many computer science students are missing the forest for the trees. The typical student is marshaled through a series of courses in programming, theory, and engineering, without pausing to appreciate the beauty of the picture at large. And the picture at large is such that hardware and software systems are tightly interrelated through a hidden web of abstractions, interfaces, and contract-based implementations. Failure to see this intricate enterprise in the flesh leaves many students and professionals with an uneasy feeling that, well, they don’t fully understand what’s going on inside computers.

I feel I am one of these referenced students. Surely, I have a great background in Computer  Science (I think), but how can I say that if I do not know how to create a simple computer? This seemed like a perfect opportunity to improve my most fundamental skills.

This repository is the space I have to organize the implementation of the projects proposed at the end of each book chapter. This repository will reflect my relatively new understanding of this subject, which I hope will improve over time. As a natural consequence, I expect that, in the near future, I will look back at some of the work I am doing there and think how naive I was.
